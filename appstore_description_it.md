Combining all of the functionalities needed in order to track Invisalign® wear times effortlessly and effectively, AlignTime is a great tool to support the journey towards straighter teeth for those who find themselves caught up in busy day-to-day life. Easy to use Aligners timer and Aligners reminders would help you to reach Invisalign® optimal daily wear time. AlignTime helps you stay on track with Invisalign® treatment by providing a simple and easy to use App. Reminders, calendar, and wear time statistics – all of this in one application.
