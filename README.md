Following specs need to be selected: Start Date, Number of Trays, Tray they are currently on (for Users, who have started downloaded the app at the middle of their treatment). Information, entered through there would be displayed in ‘My Treatment’ Section.

##### **Main functionality of ‘Today’ screen (as per mock up):**
-	Today’s date displayed at the top and users are unable to modify it
-	Wear time and time out are displayed underneath and are calculated based on tracked time:
    - Tracking is happening manually through user selecting ‘Play’(for when aligners are in) or ‘Pause’ (for when aligners have been removed)
-	Aligner # is selected automatically, based on the treatment plan. (Would look into adding functionality to updated Aligner# through this screen at any time)

-	Later there will be functionality, that would allow users to add wear time/time out.
